== Anatomy of a Gradle project

Gradle is based on a set of conventions.

Some inherited from the history of Java build systems:

* `src/main/java`
* `src/test/resources`

Others brought by Gradle:

* The name of the project is the name of the containing folder

=== Additional build artifacts

Directories:

* `buildSrc`
* `.gradle`
